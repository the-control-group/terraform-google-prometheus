# Contributing

## Reporting a bug
Use GitHub issues to report a bug or an error that you are experiencing. A good report will include:

1) A description of the issue
2) Steps to reproduce
3) What was expected to happen
4) What actually happened
5) Any additional details

## Requesting a new feature
Feature requests are best submitted through GitHub issues. We will do our best to review these
and integrate them if we feel they fit with the goals of the project and our own organization's
needs.

## Submitting a fix / feature
Please make sure to follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) when
making contributions.

Also, be as detailed as possible when submitting your pull request. Including things like links
to an existing GitHub issue or an explanation as to the problem that the pull request is attempting
to fix are strongly encouraged.

As with new feature requests, we will be evaluating PRs against the goals of the project and our own
organization's needs.

Finally, all code that you contribute will be released under the MIT license.
